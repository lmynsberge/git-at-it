# git-at-it
Thie project contains Git tools to grab data about repositories from Github (currently).

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
If you download Maven with the link below, it should take care of any dependencies you need.
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
The project uses Maven, so the only required process is to switch to the source directory (where the pom.xml is located) and run maven. See the Maven link below for more information. 

The POM should be setup to use the Main() method in RequestRunner.java for easier testing, but realistically this would probably exist as a web service called from a batch or other service.
```

## Running the tests

The project uses standard JUnit unit tests with some reliance on the Mockito framework. You can just run these from your favorite IDE.
